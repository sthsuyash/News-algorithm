# News Algorithms API UI

This is the minimal UI for the News Algorithms API. It is a simple web page that allows you to interact with the API, such that you don't need to use a tool like Postman or the main news portal.

You can view the descriptions and examples of the API endpoints, and you can also test them out by providing the required parameters.
